        <h2>Study of Flight Schedules</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted an in-depth analysis of U.S. flight departures, arrivals, cancellations, delays, and diversions from 2019 to 2023 using a 3 million records sample from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. By preprocessing and visualizing this complex dataset, I uncovered key trends in airport and airline performance, delay causes, and the impacts of major events like COVID-19. My work provides actionable insights to support better airline scheduling, airport expansion, and operational improvements
          <br><br>
          <strong>Key Insights:</strong><br>
          • Airlines operate their domestic flights more between 5AM and 12PM.
          • Atlanta was the busiest airport with 150,674 departures, closely followed by Chicago (149,979) and Dallas/Fort Worth (125,863).<br>
          • Chicago also had the most cancellations (5,038), followed by Dallas/Fort Worth (4195) and New York (3925). However, the highest cancellation rates were at smaller airports like Ogden (17.65%), and Mammoth Lakes (17.28%). The most cancellations occured due to weather related events, accounting for 36.63% of all cancellations.<br>
          • 2019 saw the highest number of flights (728,994), dropping to 444,891 in 2020 due to COVID-19, then rising again in 2021 and 2022. Average departure delay was 10.61 minutes and average arrival delay was 5.12 minutes, with delays dropping sharply in 2020 and rising again by 2023 (departure delay: 14.38 minutes; arrival delay: 9.37 minutes). Carrier-related delays were the most common, responsible for 34.86% of all delays.<br>
          • Delta Airlines operated the most flights and but only had 5982 cancellations (4th overall). JetBlue Airways caused the highest average delays (departure: 18.13 min, arrival: 12.28 min), while SouthWest Airlines had the most diversions (1,002). Only Endeavour Air Inc. achieved negative average arrival delays (i.e., flights arriving early).
